Smokey is a command line tool used to analyze assemblies and report problems. Problems include buggy code (e.g. infinite recursion, null deref, malformed format string), performance issues (e.g. string concatenation in loops, excessive boxing, large structs), violations of the .NET design guidelines (e.g. inheriting from ApplicationException or ICloneable, naming, and swallowing exceptions), and miscellaneous rules like misspelled words in string literals.

You can download Smokey from the web site: 
<http://code.google.com/p/smokey/>. The web site also has an html report for one of the System assemblies and a list of all of Smokey's rules.

This release of Smokey has 233 rules.

Changes from Smokey 1.3.0.0:
* Added nineteen new rules:
    - BaseDisposable, should have Dispose(bool) method.
    - ConfusingDispose, not IDisposable but has Dispose method.
    - ConstantResult, Equals, GetHashCode, or relational operator always returns a constant.
    - DerivedDisposable, Dispose(bool) should call base, don't have a finalizer.
    - Disposable, checks for eleven problems including improper naming, a Dispose method throwing, and Dispose(bool) using a field without a null check.
    - EqualsMissesState, Equals does not check a field exposed by a trivial get/set property.
    - Finalizeable, empty, throws, or not IDisposable.
    - HashButNoEquals, overrides GetHashCode, but not Equals.
    - InvalidEnumFlags, marked as flags but all values are sequential.
    - ISerializableMethods, not ISerializable but has (SerializationInfo, StreamingContext) ctor.
    - MutableField, externally visible field is readonly, mutable, and not a value type.
    - PreferSafeHandle, has a finalizer and an IntPtr field.
    - RedundantOperand, selected binary operator or method is invoked but both arguments are computed using identical code.
    - SerializableAttribute, exception class is not marked with SerializableAttribute. 
    - ThreadAbort, Thread.Abort was called.
    - ThreadName, thread was instantiated but not given a name.
    - ThreadSafeAttr, thread root was not marked with ThreadRootAttribute/ThreadSafeAttribute, or method called from multiple threads was not marked with ThreadSafeAttribute.
    - UseIEquatable, defines Equals but isn't IEquatable<T>.
    - VisiblePointer, externally visible IntPtr field is not readonly.
* Removed some rules (these have been folded into the new more general disposable rules):
    - BaseDisposable
    - DisposeFields
    - EmptyFinalizer
    - IDisposableWithoutSuppressFinalize
    - NoObjectDisposedException
    - OverridenFinalizer
* Removed DisposableButNoFinalizer rule (DisposeNativeResources handles it).
* Removed ignoreList setting (use dictionary setting instead).
* Write a message to stderr if aspell isn't installed (instead of reporting a bug in smokey).
* GodClass rule fires for over 60 types instead of over 40 types.
* Smokey now does a better job resolving generic types.
* File and line numbers are now retrieved using Cecil instead of the undocumented Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter, atlhough Cecil doesn't seem to be as accurate as the old code.
* Lot's of minor bug fixes, including fixes for automatic properties and mono 2.0.
