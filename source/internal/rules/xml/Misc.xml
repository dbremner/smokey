	<Violation checkID = "M1000" severity = "Warning" breaking = "true">	
		<Translation lang = "en" typeName = "UseJurassicNaming" category = "Misc">			
			<Cause>
			The above names are not using the Jurassic naming conventions.
			</Cause>
	
			<Description>
			Names should be chosen depending on what they represent:
			    || Namespace      || PascalCase
			    || Types          || PascalCase
			    || Interfaces     || IFormatting
			    || Events         || PascalCase
			    || Properties     || PascalCase
			    || Methods        || PascalCase
			    || Parameters     || argList
			    || Public fields  || PascalCase
			    || Other fields   || m_numItems/mNumItems or ms_numItems/s_numItems/sNumItems/msNumItems

			It's OK for an identifier to be all upper case if it's two characters long
			(e.g. IO). Underscores and hungarian notation should not be used. These are
			the same conventions as the .NET conventions, see
			&lt;http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x2dbyw72(VS.71).&gt; for more
			details on those.
			</Description>
	
			<Fix>
			Use the above to choose a name which is compatible with the naming convention.

	<Violation checkID = "M1001" severity = "Nitpick" breaking = "false">
		<Translation lang = "en" typeName = "SortedMethods" category = "Misc">			
			<Cause>
			A type's methods are only mostly sorted.
			</Cause>
	
			<Description>
			This rule considers the methods of a type at each access level in turn.
			If 80% or more of the methods at an access level are sorted the methods
			are considered to be sorted. If any methods at that level are not sorted
			the rule will fire.
			</Description>
	
			<Fix>
			Sort the methods correctly.
